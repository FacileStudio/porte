// Package porte is the authentication kit for the Facile Suite: the OIDC
// plumbing that six Go apps have each written separately.
//
// This package is the frozen contract only — types, interfaces and the wire
// shapes. It deliberately depends on nothing outside the standard library, so
// that an app's store and domain code never compiles against go-oidc, oauth2
// or a database driver. The engine lives in porte/oidc and the default
// PostgreSQL stores in porte/pg; only an app's main.go imports those.
//
//	porte       the contract. standard library only
//	porte/oidc  the flow, the routes and the middleware. go-oidc, oauth2, tronc, chi
//	porte/pg    the identity tables. database/sql, no ORM
//
// porte carries authentication and transports authorization. It decides
// neither: the identity provider assigns roles, the app decides what a role
// may do, and porte owns only the transport and the freshness in between.
//
// See SPEC.md for the reasoning behind every decision expressed here.
