// costs nothing and removes a runtime failure mode from the auth path.

// authenticates a session, which tells it a user id and nothing else; the

// was already making — rather than porte making that query for every handler
// that does not care. They are here because a UserStore fills them in tests
// and because v0.2's local login has them in hand at the moment it issues.

// identities.provider_id to the user's uuid for the email provider,
// better-auth sets account.accountId equal to userId for credential accounts,
// and Auth0 documents user_id as "unique and immutable".
//
// Keying on the id makes changing an address stop touching credentials at all,
// which deletes the whole failure class rather than defending against it.
