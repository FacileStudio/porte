# Changelog

Decisions are recorded with their reasoning. The reasoning is the part that stops a future
session from undoing a deliberate choice.

## v0.2.2 — 2026-08-09

`session.Manager` gained `List` and `Revoke`. The `SessionStore` contract has advertised
`ListByUser` and `DeleteByID` since v0.1 as what an "your active sessions" screen is built on,
and the manager — which exists so that one thing owns the credential — exposed neither, so the
second adopter had to keep holding the store alongside the manager to show a user their own API
token. Found by Sablier, whose named API tokens are labelled sessions.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-09

The error sentinels were decoration. `porte.go` says they exist "so a handler can map them to
status codes without matching on message text", and `porte/local` was returning
`errors.Unauthorized(porte.ErrWrongPassword.Error())` — the text, not the error — so `errors.Is`
never matched and the only way to tell a wrong password from a closed registration was to compare
strings. They are wrapped now, keeping tronc's code and therefore the HTTP status.
`ErrWeakPassword` was declared and never returned at all; it now carries the configured minimum.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-09

Local passwords, and the restructuring they forced.

### The session stops belonging to OIDC

v0.1 put session issuance, the cookie, the authenticator and the middleware inside `porte/oidc`,
because OIDC was all there was. Journal's adoption priced that mistake: an app with its own
password form could not mint a porte session or set porte's cookie, so half its logins carried an
HttpOnly cookie and the other half kept a token in `localStorage` — the exact split the cookie
was adopted to end. Five of the six remaining apps have a password form, so shipping them onto
v0.1 would have spread it.

`porte/session` is that code, extracted and unchanged in behaviour, plus the three methods v0.1
was missing: `Issue`, `IssueCookie` and `Clear`. `POST /auth/logout` moves here too, because
ending a session never was an OIDC concern. `porte/oidc` keeps `RequireAuth`, `Optional` and
`Mount`, now delegating, and gains `Sessions()`.

**Breaking:** `oidc.Deps.Sessions` is now a `*session.Manager` rather than a
`porte.SessionStore`, and the app builds the manager. Two managers over one table would each
keep their own idea of the clock and the cookie, so there is exactly one and both kits share it.
Mount the manager as well as the kit — the logout route lives on the former now.

### porte/local

Email and password, argon2id, as an identity row under the new `porte.ProviderLocal` keyed on the
normalised address. It depends on `porte/session` and not on `porte/oidc`: an app that wants only
passwords must not compile an OIDC client, which is the whole reason the manager was extracted.

The parameters are copied from the apps rather than chosen — 64 MiB, three passes, two lanes, PHC
encoding — so every hash already in a Facile database keeps verifying. Adopting this is a code
change, not a password reset.

What is shared is not the flow, which is easy, but its details, which are what drift across six
copies: the constant-time compare, the equalised timing on an unknown address, the length floor,
and the refusal to say which half of the pair was wrong. `Register` and `Login` are exported as a
service, not only as routes, because every Facile app answers `{token, user}` and porte has no
idea what a user looks like — the app keeps its response shape and porte keeps the credential.

**A human may hold a password identity and a federated one at once, and they are one account.**
Registering a password against an address that already signed in through the IdP adds a row; it
does not create a second user and does not disturb the OIDC subject. That is what identities
having their own table since v0.1 was for.

porte cannot make registration race-free by itself: counting accounts and inserting one must
happen under a lock on a database porte does not own. `Deps.Count` and `PasswordUserStore` are
the app's, and every Facile app already takes the advisory lock.

### porte/avatarfs

The filesystem `AvatarStore` five apps have each written, once. Atomic writes, so a concurrent
read never sees half a file; a key guard, because a store that joins a caller-supplied string
onto a path is a directory traversal waiting for its second caller; and a handler that serves
only names `Put` could have written.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-08-08

What the first adoption found. Journal — the one suite app with no OIDC at all, so the
integration adds rather than replaces — hit three things in the first hour of wiring, and all
three are the same shape: `porte` had decided something on the app's behalf that was not its to
decide.

- **`Mount` owned `/auth/config` outright, so an app could not keep its own key there.** Every
  Facile app serves a superset of `sso_only` and `oidc_enabled` at that path — Journal adds
  `allow_registration`, Jardin a legacy `password_auth` — and registering the route a second
  time makes chi panic at boot. `Deps.ConfigExtra func() map[string]any` merges the app's fields
  in, and `porte` writes its own two keys over the result: the frontend decides whether to draw
  a password form on those two, so they answer to the configuration and nothing else. Nil is
  today's behaviour byte for byte.
- **`/auth/logout` was mounted only when OIDC was enabled.** It is session management: it needs
  the `SessionStore` that `New` already demands whether or not a provider is configured. An app
  with SSO switched off therefore had to keep its own logout handler and a second response
  shape, and inherited a route collision on the day it switched SSO on — which is precisely the
  day nobody is looking at logout. It is now always mounted. `/auth/sync-profile` stays
  OIDC-only; refreshing a profile against an identity provider means nothing without one.
- **`attachClaims` documented itself as filling `Identity.Email` and `Identity.Name`. It never
  did.** No store on the authenticated path holds either — `StoredIdentity` carries no email —
  so the fields were silently empty for every consumer that trusted the comment. The comment now
  says what the code does, and `Identity` records that hydrating a profile is the app's job:
  `porte` authenticates a session, which tells it a user id and nothing else, and going to the
  app's user table for a name would double the cost of every authenticated request to serve the
  handlers that do not need one. Journal reads its own row into its own context, which is the
  query it was already making.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-08

OIDC only, as SPEC §4 scopes it: no local password, no `porte/espace`. The contract, the engine,
the PostgreSQL stores and the flow are complete and the whole thing is walked end to end against
a conformant issuer. **No application has adopted it in production yet** — that is the next
milestone, not this one, and it is why there is no `docs/architecture.md`.

### Proving the flow, and the hardening that came out of it

The engine had never spoken to an identity provider. SPEC §13 called PKCE, the nonce and the
back-channel logout token "the three paths a unit test cannot honestly cover, because they are
assertions about what the *provider* does" — which is true of a fake that only echoes what it is
handed. `oidc/flow_test.go` is a conformant in-process issuer instead: it signs RS256 tokens
behind a real JWKS, and its token endpoint **enforces** PKCE, the redirect URI and client
authentication rather than trusting the client to have sent them. The flow, the CLI exchange,
back-channel logout and the roles claim are now walked end to end, and a kit that dropped its
verifier or reused a nonce fails.

A parallel security review ran against the result. Seven findings survived adversarial
verification; four more were raised and refuted, and the refutations are worth as much:

- **The avatar SSRF guard let the IPv6 forms that embed an IPv4 address through.**
  `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe` (NAT64) and `2002:a9fe:a9fe::` (6to4) both reach the cloud metadata
  service, and every predicate in `net` says they are ordinary public IPv6 — `To4` only unwraps
  the IPv4-mapped form. They are now unwrapped to the address they actually reach and checked
  again, along with the deprecated `::a.b.c.d` form, Teredo, and the reserved IPv4 ranges `net`
  has no predicate for (CGNAT, the TEST-NETs, `240/4`, broadcast). NAT64 wrapping a *public*
  address still passes: on an IPv6-only host every IPv4 destination arrives in that form, so
  blocking the prefix outright would break every legitimate fetch.
- **The UserInfo response was never checked against the subject that asked for it.** OpenID
  Connect Core §5.3.2 makes this a MUST and `go-oidc` does not do it for you — it fetches and
  parses, nothing more. Without it a UserInfo response for somebody else rewrites this user's
  email, which is the key the rest of the suite joins on.
- **Cookies carry the `__Host-` prefix over https.** Every app in the suite sits on a subdomain
  of one parent, and a plain cookie named `session` scoped to the parent domain is
  indistinguishable at the server from the app's own host-only one — so one XSS, one rogue app or
  one subdomain takeover next door is enough to plant a look-alike and fix a victim into the
  attacker's session. The prefix is the one cookie property that cannot be forged: a browser
  accepts it only when the cookie is `Secure`, `Path=/` and carries no `Domain`. Over https the
  unprefixed name is **not read** unless `Config.AcceptLegacyCookie` is set: an unconditional
  fallback accepts precisely the cookie the attack plants, which would make the prefix
  decoration, and it is worst against a user who is not signed in and has no prefixed cookie for
  a preference order to prefer. The migration switch is meant to be on for one `SessionTTL` and
  then off. Over plain http the bare name is the only one a browser keeps, so it is the only one
  read there.
- **`Secure` is derived from the configuration as well as the request.** The per-request test is
  right behind Traefik and stays, but `Config.HTTPS()` now overrides it upward and never
  downward: a proxy that stops sending `X-Forwarded-Proto` must not be able to talk `porte` into
  shipping the session cookie in the clear.
- **Sessions gained an idle window.** `DefaultSessionIdleTTL` is seven days inside the thirty-day
  absolute lifetime, and it is the one default `porte` does not inherit from the apps — none of
  them can age out an unused session at all. Active users never meet it; a borrowed laptop stops
  being a month-long credential. It applies to the **cookie transport only**: everything arriving
  as a bearer is a CLI or an API token, which is idle by design and is the one class of
  credential with no human present to renew it. A negative `SessionIdleTTL` disables it.
- **`porte/pg` can finally tell a replayed login code from a typo.** The contract has always
  specified `ErrCodeConsumed` for the first case, and the shipped store returned `ErrNotFound`
  for both, so the replay branch in the engine was unreachable. `Consume` now stamps
  `consumed_at` under a conditional `UPDATE` rather than deleting: still exactly-once, still
  atomic, and what survives is the hash of a credential that is already spent. `DeleteExpired`
  sweeps those rows on the same schedule as the unused ones.
- **`IdentityStore.MarkRolesSynced` replaces a read-modify-write that could lose a token
  rotation.** When a role refresh fails, `porte` still records the attempt so a dead refresh
  token is not retried on every request — but it was doing that by saving back the whole identity
  it had read *before* the attempt, which would restore the old refresh token over one a
  concurrent request had just rotated in, and a lost rotation means every later refresh fails.
  One column, one statement, no read-modify-write. Apps implementing `IdentityStore` themselves
  gain a fourth method.
- **Concurrent first logins resolve to one user.** The pre-insert email check is a read in a
  `READ COMMITTED` transaction, so a double click, two tabs or a retried callback both passed it
  and one died on the unique index — the raw 500 on the login path that the check exists to
  prevent. The insert is now `ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING RETURNING id` with a re-select, so
  the loser adopts the winner's row — and the conflict path re-applies the unverified-email
  guard rather than assuming it, because two *different* subjects can reach it with the same
  address, and adopting there would be the takeover the guard exists to refuse.
- `POST /auth/oidc/exchange` answers with `Cache-Control: no-store`. It is the token endpoint of
  the CLI flow in everything but name.
- An expired or idled-out session row is deleted when it is presented, rather than left to the
  sweeper to find.

Refuted, and recorded so they are not re-litigated: `SameSite=Strict` is not deployable here —
the `oidc_state` cookie has to survive the top-level cross-site redirect back from the provider,
and `Strict` would withhold it and break every login at the callback. The custom-header check the
browser-apps BCP offers as the sanctioned alternative is enforced on every mutating cookie
request, so `Lax` is compliance rather than a gap. Clearing the stored IdP tokens on logout was
also refused: they are user-scoped and shared across a user's other live sessions, and
Back-Channel Logout §2.7 explicitly exempts `offline_access` refresh tokens, which is exactly
what the CLI and the role refresh need.

### The engine and the stores

`porte/oidc` and `porte/pg`: the flow, the seven routes, the middleware, the SSRF-guarded avatar
fetch, and the four tables. Tested against a real PostgreSQL, not a fake — every interesting
behaviour in `pg` is PostgreSQL's own.

- **`porte/oidc` is a separate package, not the root.** SPEC §8 put the implementation in the
  root package, which contradicts the zero-dependency decision taken with the contract: an app's
  `UserStore` must not compile against `go-oidc`. The literal promise is unreachable inside one
  module anyway — `go.mod` requirements are module-scoped — but the layering is worth keeping,
  and it costs one import line in `main.go`. Only that file sees the engine.
- **Four store types in `porte/pg`, not one.** `SessionStore.Find` takes a token hash and
  `IdentityStore.Find` takes a provider and a subject; Go cannot carry both on one receiver.
  Renaming a method to dodge that would leak a storage accident into the contract.
- **The Go floor is 1.25, not 1.24.** SPEC §8 left this open and leaned 1.24 on the principle
  that a library floors low. `go-oidc` v3.20 requires 1.25, so the dependency decided. It costs
  nothing: the apps are on 1.25 and `tronc/migrate` already declares 1.25.7.
- **The avatar SSRF guard now runs inside the dialer.** All six existing copies resolve the
  hostname, check the addresses, then call `http.Get` — which resolves again. A DNS record that
  answers publicly on the first lookup and privately on the second walks straight through.
  Checking at connect time closes that window and covers redirects for free.
- **`UpsertFromOIDC` refuses an unverified email that already belongs to someone**, with a
  message, instead of hitting the unique index and returning a 500 from the login path.
- **The startup guard is split in two**, because only half of it is checkable at boot: `New`
  verifies the roles scope against the discovery document, and the callback fails loudly when
  the scope was granted but no claim arrived. Between them there is no path where a
  half-configured provider denies everyone in silence.

### Contract corrections, found by implementing it

SPEC §11 froze the contract and asked for a review before anything was built on it. Writing the
implementation *was* the review, and it found three things wrong:

- **`LoginCode.SessionID` is gone.** The session is created at exchange time, not at callback
  time. The old shape could not work: the session row stores only a hash, so handing the CLI a
  usable token later would have meant keeping the plaintext at rest. The stated reason for
  creating it up front — avoiding a second write path that could half-succeed — does not survive
  contact with the fact that creating a session is one insert. `Consume` is atomic, so a code
  still yields at most one session.
- **`AvatarStore.Put` takes an opaque key, not a user id**, and `Claims` gained `AvatarURL` and
  `AvatarKey()`. The old signature had an ordering problem with no solution: the avatar URL must
  reach the app's user row, the app writes that row in `UpsertFromOIDC`, and `Put` needed a user
  id that does not exist until that call returns. Keying on the identity instead lets the fetch
  run first and the URL ride into the upsert. A stable key also means a re-sync overwrites rather
  than accumulating one file per login.
- **`Config.Validate` requires an absolute http(s) issuer.** The old check called `url.Parse` and
  tested the error, which catches almost nothing: `sso.facile.studio` parses fine as a relative
  path, and the failure surfaces later as an opaque discovery error naming neither the variable
  nor the problem.

### The frozen contract, as Go types

`porte.go`, `identity.go` and `session.go`: types, interfaces and wire shapes only, no
behaviour. This is SPEC.md §11's first step, taken after diffing the six `modules/auth/`
implementations rather than before.

- **Zero dependencies, standard library only.** An app implementing `UserStore` must not
  inherit `go-oidc`, `golang.org/x/oauth2` or a database driver from `porte`. That is why
  `Claims` carries plain fields and `TokenSet` exists instead of an `*oauth2.Token`. The
  implementation may depend on whatever it needs; the boundary an app sees may not.
- **`Identity.UserID` is an `int64`.** Every app passes a decimal string around today. The
  conversion moves to the edge, and the type matches `porte_users.id` and the `int64` foreign
  keys already in place. `ExchangeResponse.UserID` stays a string on the wire: to a CLI it is
  an opaque identifier, so breaking it buys nothing.
- **The middleware yields a typed `Identity`.** It replaces
  `Authenticate(ctx, string) (string, any, error)` followed by an
  `interface{ GetEmail() string }` assertion, which is a runtime failure mode sitting in the
  auth path of six apps.
- **Stores take hashes, never tokens.** Keeping the plaintext out of the store interface is
  what stops it reaching a log line or a query parameter.
- **`SessionStore.Find` does not filter on expiry.** An expired session and a missing one are
  different answers, and only the caller knows which error to return.
- **`ErrCodeConsumed` is separate from `ErrNotFound`.** A replayed login code is an attack;
  an unknown one is a typo. One error value buys that distinction in the logs.
- **`CSRFHeaderName` is `X-Facile-CSRF`, any non-empty value** (SPEC §7 Q5). No app sends a
  CSRF header today, so the name was free. Presence is the whole signal — a browser will not
  attach a custom header cross-site without a preflight — so there is no token to mint,
  distribute or rotate.
- **`DefaultClaimsTTL` is five minutes** (SPEC §7 Q6), deliberately the same number as the
  existing `profile_synced_at` rate limit. One refresh cadence, not two.
- **`SessionCookieName` is `session`,** taken from Courrier and Agenda, which already ship the
  cookie transport. Adopting their name means those two do not have to log everyone out twice.

### SPEC.md corrected against source

The diff found three claims that had gone stale, all dated in place rather than deleted:

- **Matching on `sub` is already fixed in all six apps** — it is the HEAD commit of every
  `modules/auth/`, and every `schemas/user.go` now carries `OIDCSubject *string uniqueIndex`.
  It was listed as "the most severe item"; `porte` now preserves it instead of introducing it.
- **The cookie transport is already live in Courrier and Agenda**, including a `Secure` flag
  derived from `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which is the correct test behind Traefik.
- **Constant-time state comparison already exists in Plume.** PKCE and the nonce are still
  missing everywhere, as specified.

New findings recorded: Courrier and Agenda encrypt OIDC tokens at rest while four apps do not;
Courrier's middleware still accepts `?token=` and Vision's `?api_key=`, which `porte` will not
carry forward; `authcrypto` has three distinct hashes across seven apps, not one.

### Repo

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, copied from `caisse` and pinned to Go 1.24 — the floor `go.mod`
  documents. Held back until the first package existed, because `go vet ./...` on an empty
  module exits non-zero. The PostgreSQL service is present from the start: a database test that
  skips itself when the URL is unset passes silently, and a green CI that ran nothing is worse
  than a red one.
